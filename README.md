# Day 2 Task

DO NOT FORK THIS REPOSITORY for the assignment.

### Setup

First, examine the example of a text prompt button [here](https://rmccrear.github.io/week-5-day-2-demo-js-may-2024/).

Create a new repository on GitHub for today's project. Create a file called index.html. Create three more HTML files for your swaps and three JS files for your javascript.

### Instructions

Create your own webpage with at least 3 pages and 3 js script files. (4 pages if you include index.html)

Each page should have a header, paragraph and button. The button will use JavaScript to...

1. Ask the user for input with a prompt
2. Use that input to create a message as a string
3. Insert the message into the page using innerHTML.

Add an index.html page to link your pages together in a nav. 

Bonus: Feel free to spruce things up with CSS or to add more tags you'd like to change.

Bonus: exercise your skill by adding a little math or string template magic to your page. Get creative and have fun


### Turn in

At the end of the week, paste in links to your three repos for grading. Be sure to indicate which repo is for which day.

## User Story

We can explain what we want a program to do with "User Stories". This is an industry standard way of explaining the specifications for software in a way that both technical and non-technical stakeholders can understand.

A user story for this task could be:

    As a USER, I want to click a button and input a complaint about someone. The computer will write a note with a softer tone so my complaint does not sound so demanding.
